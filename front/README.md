Submitted 2/21/2022


ABOUT:
The Tavern is a restaurant management style app for a fantasy tavern.  

This project allows a manager of this tavern to manage all aspects of day to day operations.
You can manage Employees, Inventory, Quests, and Rooms on this application.  

In a practical sense, one could update information, add new inventory, hire/fire new employees, and update/remove quests and/or room statuses.  

We were inspired by our mutual interest in fantasy settings to make a fun app based around everyone's favorite fantasy meeting spot.  

TO USE:
Navigation is simple point and click.  To add a new item/employee/quest etc, simply click the add button and fill in the fields, then click the submit button.  To delete an item, click delete.  

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
We utilized MongoDB to host our database, with express and mongoose to tie it together on the backend.  We use React to create the frontend, along with React-Bootstrap and Bootstrap for styling.

KNOWN ISSUES/MISSING FEATURES
1. When adding a new object on any page, page must be manually refreshed to show new item, otherwise page will get stuck in loading state.  
2. Currently, the edit feature is not functional on the front end.  It is functional using postman on the backend.
